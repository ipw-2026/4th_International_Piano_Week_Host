        bio: `Brazilian-Italian pianist <b>Junia Canton</b> has established a distinguished career as a performer, researcher, and professor. She holds a <b>Ph.D. in Music</b> from the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG, 2024), a Master's in Musical Performance (UFMG, 2002), and a Specialist degree in Brazilian Music from the State University of Minas Gerais (UEMG, 2001). Her artistic formation includes studies with renowned Brazilian pianists Celina Szrvinsk, Luis Senise, Berenice Menegale, and Eduardo Hazan, as well as Dutch pianist Frédéric Meinders. Since 1998, Dr. Canton has served as <b>Professor of Piano, Chamber Music, and Brazilian Music</b> at the State University of Minas Gerais (UEMG). A dedicated pedagogue, her students have garnered over 320 prizes in competitions across Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, and the United States. Many of her alumni have performed as soloists with major ensembles—including the Minas Gerais Philharmonic and the São Paulo Prelúdio Orchestra—and now hold prestigious academic and performance positions worldwide. As a concert pianist, Junia Canton performs regularly as a soloist and chamber musician throughout Brazil, Portugal, Italy, and the United States. She maintains a frequent and versatile collaborative schedule, performing with string quartets, in duos with strings, and in piano duos. Notable performances include first piano in Stravinsky's <i>Les Noces</i> and Orff's <i>Catulli Carmina</i> at the Palácio das Artes in Belo Horizonte, as well as concertos by Bach, Mozart, and Saint-Saëns. Dr. Canton is a leading researcher and interpreter of Brazilian music, recognized particularly for her expertise in the works of post-modernist composer <b>J. A. R. de Almeida Prado</b>. Her doctoral research offered a truly transdisciplinary perspective by integrating fields such as Neuroscience, Movement Biomechanics, Musicology, and Performance. Her full thesis, <i>"Almeida Prado's Kinderszenen: A Transdisciplinary Contribution to Piano Pedagogy"</i>, is available <a href='https://repositorio.ufmg.br/server/api/core/bitstreams/67e92046-004a-4369-ae26-10160d1e4389/content' target='_blank'>online here</a> A pivotal moment in her artistic development occurred during her Master's studies, when she had the distinct privilege of working directly with the composer himself. Under Almeida Prado's personal mentorship, she studied his 16 <i>Poesilúdios</i>, gaining authoritative and firsthand insight into his interpretative intentions. Her engagement with Brazilian repertoire extends to media productions, such as the project "Memória da Música Brasileira," which can be viewed here: <a href='https://youtu.be/1Q2cBXF4jUY?si=F8auN868t4Y1bxm3' target='_blank'>Performance I</a>, <a href='https://youtu.be/2v47e9LfSVc?si=B--StKFxqpW-xYTp' target='_blank'>Performance II</a>, and <a href='https://youtu.be/KFqyJtQ--uw?si=5jGjZIDHf4BYMIY6' target='_blank'>Performance III</a>.
